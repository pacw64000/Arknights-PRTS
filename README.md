# Arknights-PRTS
Trying to make an bot to play arknights bc im too lazy, and also to learn how to make ai

# Not really an AI
Well in the middle of the project i kinda of gave up on the AI part and just made it do stuff based on images
so its not really made for anyone else to use, but if you want to try and make it work for you go for it

# Whats working right now
Soo.. it basicaly cant do anything right now. （*゜ー゜*）

# What im going to do next
I have no idea.
However, im going to try and make it be able to select a level and then play it.

# Can i fork this?
Yes, but i dont you should, the code is a mess and im not really going to be updating it. (unless i get bored again and want to work on it)
though i will probably be updating the images on the training materials and Comparatives
